# Journey 2 BackEnd

### Pitch

As a Traveler, I find that decisions are based upon finances. I need an application to plan, organize, and budget my trip. 

**Goal**  
To Create a dynamic organization of vacation data that delivers efficiently to the client. 

### Tech Stack
- Prisma
- Docker
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
- Apollo server
- Jsonwebtoken
- Bcryptjs


### Current Problems
- Deployment issues
Must Choose:
1. Changing to Prisma Cloud / Heroku / PostgreSQL (dynamic & easy to scale)
2. Deploying Docker - Prisma and MongoDB Images (App currently built and heading into that direction, but now as dynamic as choice 1.)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### 'prisma admin'

Opens up the Prisma Database GUI

### 'npm run dev'

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**('cmd' + 'url') in terminal ** 
will open the GraphQL playground 
- access schema and docs
- write mutations and queries with passed variables and headers<br/>
(**translatable code for client to run**)

 ### 'npm run start'
Runs the app in the production mode.
